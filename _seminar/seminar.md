Welcome to the **Student Analysis Seminar** at UC Santa Barbara!

In Summer 2025, we’ll explore the phenomenon of measure concentration and the applications of it to functional inequalities, PDE's, geometry, probability, and statistics. The main references we'll refer to are
- Asaf Naor's lecture notes
- Michel Ledoux's book *The Concentration of Measure Phenomenon*
- *Concentration of Measure for the Analysis of
Randomised Algorithms* by Devdatt P. Dubhashi & Alessandro Panconesi

## Location & Time
We will meet in South Hall 6635 at 12:30PM on Tuesdays. After meetings, any lecture notes from the presenter
will be linked and posted below.
